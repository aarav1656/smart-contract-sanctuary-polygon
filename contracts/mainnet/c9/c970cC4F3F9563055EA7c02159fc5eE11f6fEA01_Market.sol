 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/**
 * @title Nori Inc.'s carbon removal marketplace.
 * @author Nori Inc.
 * @notice Facilitates the exchange of ERC20 with permit tokens for a non-transferrable certificate of carbon removal.
 * @dev Carbon removals are represented by ERC1155 tokens in the Removal contract, where the balance of a
 * given token represents the number of tonnes of carbon that were removed from the atmosphere for that specific
 * removal (different token IDs are used to represent different slices of carbon removal projects and years).
 * This contract facilitates the exchange of ERC20 tokens for ERC721 tokens managed by the Certificate contract.
 * Each of these certificates is a non-transferrable, non-fungible token that owns the specific removal tokens
 * and token balances that comprise the specific certificate for the amount purchased.
 *
 * The market maintains a "priority restricted threshold", which is a configurable threshold of supply that is
 * always reserved to sell only to buyers who have the `ALLOWLIST_ROLE`.  Purchases that would drop supply below
 * this threshold will revert without the correct role.
 *
 * ###### Additional behaviors and features
 *
 * - [Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
 * - [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable): all external functions that mutate
 * state are pausable.
 * - [Role-based access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
 * - `MARKET_ADMIN_ROLE`: Can set the fee percentage, fee wallet address, and priority restricted threshold.
 * - `ALLOWLIST_ROLE`: Can purchase from priority restricted supply.
 * - [Can receive ERC1155 tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc1155#IERC1155Receiver)

/**
 * @title An extended ERC1155 token contract for carbon removal accounting.
 * @author Nori Inc.
 * @notice This contract uses ERC1155 tokens as an accounting system for keeping track of carbon that Nori has
 * verified to have been removed from the atmosphere. Each token ID encodes information about the source of the
 * removed carbon (see the [RemovalIdLib docs](../docs/RemovalIdLib.md) for encoding details), and each token represents
 * the smallest unit of carbon removal accounting.  For example, in an agricultural methodology, a specific token ID
 * represents one parcel of land in a specific year.  The total supply of that token ID is the number of tonnes of
 * carbon removed.
 *
 * ##### Additional behaviors and features:
 *
 * ###### Minting
 * - Only accounts with the CONSIGNOR_ROLE can mint removal tokens, which should only be account(s) controlled by Nori.
 * - When removal tokens are minted, additional data about those removals are stored in a mapping keyed by the token ID,
 * such as a project ID and a holdback percentage (which determines the percentage of the sale proceeds from the token
 * that will be routed to the RestrictedNORI contract). A restriction schedule is created per `projectId` (if necessary)
 * in RestrictedNORI (see the [RestrictedNORI docs](../docs/RestrictedNORI.md)).
 * - Minting reverts when attempting to mint a token ID that already exists.
 * - The function `addBalance` can be used to mint additional balance to a token ID that already exists.
 *
 *
 * ###### Listing
 * - _Listing_ refers to the process of listing removal tokens for sale in Nori's marketplace (the Market contract).
 * - Removals are listed for sale by transferring ownership of the tokens to the Market contract via
 * `consign`. Alternatively, If the `to` argument to `mintBatch` is the address of the Market contract,
 * removal tokens will be listed in the same transaction that they are minted.
 * - Only accounts with the CONSIGNOR_ROLE can list removals for sale in the market.
 *
 *
 * ###### Releasing
 * - _Releasing_ refers to the process of accounting for carbon that has failed to meet its permanence guarantee
 * and has been released into the atmosphere prematurely.
 * - This accounting is performed by burning the affected balance of a removal that has been released.
 * - Only accounts with the RELEASER_ROLE can initiate a release.
 * - When a removal token is released, balances are burned in a specific order until the released amount
 * has been accounted for: Releasing burns first from unlisted balances, second from listed balances and third from the
 * certificate contract (see `Removal.release` for more).
 * - Affected certificates will have any released balances replaced by new removals purchased by Nori, though an
 * automated implementation of this process is beyond the scope of this version of the contracts.
 *
 *
 * ###### Token ID encoding and decoding
 * - This contract uses the inlined library RemovalIdLib for uint256.
 * - When minting tokens, an array of structs containing information about each removal is passed as an argument to
 * `mintBatch` and that data is used to generate the encoded token IDs for each removal.
 * - `decodeRemovalIdV0` is exposed externally for encoding and decoding Removal token IDs that contain uniquely
 * identifying information about the removal. See the [RemovalIdLib docs](../docs/RemovalIdLib.md) for encoding details.
 *

 * - [Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
 * - [Initializable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#multiple-inheritance)
 * - [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable): all functions that mutate state are
 * pausable
 * - [Role-based access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
 * - `CONSIGNOR_ROLE`: Can mint removal tokens and list them for sale in the Market contract.
 * - `RELEASER_ROLE`: Can release partial or full removal balances.

/**
 * @title A wrapped ERC20 token contract for restricting the release of tokens for use as insurance
 * collateral.
 * @author Nori Inc.
 * @notice Based on the mechanics of a wrapped ERC-20 token, this contract layers schedules over the withdrawal
 * functionality to implement _restriction_, a time-based release of tokens that, until released, can be reclaimed
 * by Nori to enforce the permanence guarantee of carbon removals.
 *
 * ##### Behaviors and features:
 *
 * ###### Schedules
 *
 * - _Schedules_ define the release timeline for restricted tokens.
 * - A specific schedule is associated with one ERC1155 token ID and can have multiple token holders.
 *
 * ###### Restricting
 *
 * - _Restricting_ is the process of gradually releasing tokens that may need to be recaptured by Nori in the event
 * that the sequestered carbon for which the tokens were exchanged is found to violate its permanence guarantee.
 * In this case, tokens need to be recaptured to mitigate the loss and make the original buyer whole by using them to
 * purchase new NRTs on their behalf.
 * - Tokens are released linearly from the schedule's start time until its end time. As NRTs are sold, proceeds may
 * be routed to a restriction schedule at any point in the schedule's timeline, thus increasing the total balance of
 * the schedule as well as the released amount at the current timestamp (assuming it's after the schedule start time).
 *
 * ###### Transferring
 *
 * - A given schedule is a logical overlay to a specific 1155 token. This token can have any number of token holders
 * if restricted tokens for a given schedule are minted to multiple addresses, but RestrictedNORI cannot be transferred
 * between addresses. Ownership percentages are relevant and enforced during withdrawal and revocation.
 *
 * ###### Withdrawal
 *
 * - _Withdrawal_ is the process of a token holder claiming the tokens that have been released by the restriction
 * schedule. When tokens are withdrawn, the 1155 schedule token is burned, and the underlying ERC20 token being held
 * by this contract is sent to the address specified by the token holder performing the withdrawal.
 * Tokens are released by a schedule based on the linear release of the schedule's `totalSupply`, but a token holder
 * can only withdraw released tokens in proportion to their percentage ownership of the schedule tokens.
 *
 * ###### Revocation
 *
 * - _Revocation_ is the process of tokens being recaptured by Nori to enforce carbon permanence guarantees.
 * Only unreleased tokens can ever be revoked. When tokens are revoked from a schedule, the current number of released
 * tokens does not decrease, even as the schedule's total supply decreases through revocation (a floor is enforced).
 * When these tokens are revoked, the 1155 schedule token is burned, and the underlying ERC20 token held by this
 * contract is sent to the address specified by Nori. If a schedule has multiple token holders, tokens are burned from
 * each holder in proportion to their total percentage ownership of the schedule.
 *
 * ###### Additional behaviors and features
 *
 * - [Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
 * - [Initializable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#multiple-inheritance)
 * - [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable): all functions that mutate state are
 * pausable.
 * - [Role-based access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
 * - `SCHEDULE_CREATOR_ROLE`: Can create restriction schedules without sending the underlying tokens to the contract.
 * The market contract has this role and sets up relevant schedules as removal tokens are minted.
 * - `MINTER_ROLE`: Can call `mint` on this contract, which mints tokens of the correct schedule ID (token ID) for a
 * given removal. The market contract has this role and can mint RestrictedNORI while routing sale proceeds to this
 * contract.
 * - `TOKEN_REVOKER_ROLE`: Can revoke unreleased tokens from a schedule. Only Nori admin wallet should have this role.
 * - `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause and unpause the contract.
 * - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: This is the only role that can add/revoke other accounts to any of the roles.
