/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
 * this function so it returns a different value.
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @title YearnV3 Base Strategy
 * @author yearn.finance
 * @notice
 *  BaseStrategy implements all of the required functionality to be a fully
 *  permisionless ERC-4626 compliant Vault. It utilizes a simplified and
 *  immutable version of the ERC-2535 'Diamond Pattern' to keep the BaseStrategy
 *  simple and small. All needed logic is held withen the `BaseLibrary` and
 *  is reused over any n strategies all using the `fallback` function to
 *  delegatecall this library so that strategists can only be concerned
 *  with writing the implementation specific code.
 *
 *  This contract should be inherited and the three main abstract methods
 *  `_invest`, `_freeFunds` and `_totalInvested` implemented to adapt the
 *  Strategy to the particular needs it has to create a return. There are
 *  other optional methods that can be implemented to further customize
 *  the strategy if desired.
 *
 *  All default storage for the implementation wil will controlled and
 *  updated by the `BaseLibrary`. The library holds a storage struct that
 *  contains all needed global variables in a manual storage slot at roughly
 *  1e77. This means strategists can feel free to implement their own storage
 *  variables as they need with no concern of collisions. All global variables
 *  can be viewed within the implementation by a simple call using the
 *  `BaseLibrary` variable. IE: BaseLibrary.globalVariable();.
