/**
 * @title EIP-20: ERC-20 Token Standard
 *
 * @notice The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20), proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller in November 2015,
 *      is a Token Standard that implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.
 *
 * @notice It provides functionalities like to transfer tokens from one account to another,
 *      to get the current token balance of an account and also the total supply of the token available on the network.
 *      Besides these it also has some other functionalities like to approve that an amount of
 *      token from an account can be spent by a third party account.
 *
 * @notice If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-20 Token
 *      Contract and, once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens on Ethereum.
 *
 * @notice See https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/
 * @notice See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20

/**
 * @title Access Control List
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable specific
 *      functions (public functions) of the smart contract for everyone.
 * @notice User roles are designed to restrict access to specific
 *      functions (restricted functions) of the smart contract to some users.
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.
