 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 * ```
 * function foo() public {

 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *

 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit

/**
 * @dev Staking contract that implements the ERC20 interface to act as a wrapped token for a foreign ERC20 token.
 *
 * It allows minting and redeeming wrapped tokens based on an APY rate that needs to be set manually by a trusted party.
 * Every time an account deposits tokens, it receives wrapped tokens based on the current APY rate.
 * Every time an account redeems wrapped tokens, it receives underlying tokens based on the current APY rate.
 * On every deposit and redeem, the staking contract can charge a deposit and redeem fees respectively.
 * In order to keep the staking contract collateralized, the trusted party must be controlling the current APY and
 * update it or re-collateralize the contract if necessary. For this reason a trusted party can withdraw any amount
 * of underlying tokens.
 *
 * Additionally, this implementation includes a whitelisting process. In case it is active, a trusted party can
 * decide which accounts are able to operate the staking contract by whitelisting each of them manually.
 * All the trusted parties mentioned above are implemented using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl module.
