/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 *
 * @dev This contract is a direct copy of OpenZeppelin's InitializableUpgradeable,

 *
 * @dev This contract provides base functionality for an ERC721 token.
 * @dev It adds support for recall, multiple drops, pausible, ownable, access
 *      roles, and OFAC sanctions compliance.
 * @dev default recall period is 14 days from minting. Once you have received
 *      your NFT and have verified you can access it, you can call
 *      `makeUnrecallable(uint256)` with your token id to turn off recall for 
 *      your token.
 * @dev Roles used by the access management are
 *      - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: administers the other roles
 *      - MODERATOR_ROLE_NAME: administers the banned role
 *      - CREATOR_ROLE_NAME: can mint/burn tokens and manage URIs/content
 *      - CUSTOMER_SERVICE: can recall tokens sent to invalid/inaccessible 
 *        addresses within a limited time window.
 *      - BANNED_ROLE: cannot send or receive tokens
 * @dev A "drop" is a pool of reserved tokens with a common base URI,
 *      representing a subset within a collection.
 * @dev If you want an NFT that can evolve through various states, support for
 *      that is available here, but it will be more convenient to extend from
 *      ViciMultiStateERC721
 * @dev the tokenURI function returns the URI for the token metadata. The token 
 *      URI returned is determined by these methods, in order of precedence: 
 *      Custom URI > Dynamic URI > BaseURI/tokenId
 * @dev the Custom URI is set for individual tokens
 * @dev Dynamic URIs are set at the drop level, or at the contract level for 
 *      tokens minted outside of a drop.
 * @dev BaseURIs are set at the drop level, at the state level if using the 
 *      state machine features, and at the contract level for tokens minted 
 *      outside of a drop.
