 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/**
 * @title An extended ERC1155 token contract for carbon removal accounting.
 * @author Nori Inc.
 * @notice This contract uses ERC1155 tokens as an accounting system for keeping track of carbon that Nori has
 * verified to have been removed from the atmosphere. Each token ID encodes information about the source of the
 * removed carbon (see the [RemovalIdLib docs](../docs/RemovalIdLib.md) for encoding details), and each token represents
 * the smallest unit of carbon removal accounting.  For example, in an agricultural methodology, a specific token ID
 * represents one parcel of land in a specific year.  The total supply of that token ID is the number of tonnes of
 * carbon removed.
 *
 * ##### Additional behaviors and features:
 *
 * ###### Minting
 * - Only accounts with the CONSIGNOR_ROLE can mint removal tokens, which should only be account(s) controlled by Nori.
 * - When removal tokens are minted, additional data about those removals are stored in a mapping keyed by the token ID,
 * such as a project ID and a holdback percentage (which determines the percentage of the sale proceeds from the token
 * that will be routed to the RestrictedNORI contract). A restriction schedule is created per `projectId` (if necessary)
 * in RestrictedNORI (see the [RestrictedNORI docs](../docs/RestrictedNORI.md)).
 * - Minting reverts when attempting to mint a token ID that already exists.
 * - The function `addBalance` can be used to mint additional balance to a token ID that already exists.
 *
 *
 * ###### Listing
 * - _Listing_ refers to the process of listing removal tokens for sale in Nori's marketplace (the Market contract).
 * - Removals are listed for sale by transferring ownership of the tokens to the Market contract via
 * `consign`. Alternatively, If the `to` argument to `mintBatch` is the address of the Market contract,
 * removal tokens will be listed in the same transaction that they are minted.
 * - Only accounts with the CONSIGNOR_ROLE can list removals for sale in the market.
 *
 *
 * ###### Releasing
 * - _Releasing_ refers to the process of accounting for carbon that has failed to meet its permanence guarantee
 * and has been released into the atmosphere prematurely.
 * - This accounting is performed by burning the affected balance of a removal that has been released.
 * - Only accounts with the RELEASER_ROLE can initiate a release.
 * - When a removal token is released, balances are burned in a specific order until the released amount
 * has been accounted for: Releasing burns first from unlisted balances, second from listed balances and third from the
 * certificate contract (see `Removal.release` for more).
 * - Affected certificates will have any released balances replaced by new removals purchased by Nori, though an
 * automated implementation of this process is beyond the scope of this version of the contracts.
 *
 *
 * ###### Token ID encoding and decoding
 * - This contract uses the inlined library RemovalIdLib for uint256.
 * - When minting tokens, an array of structs containing information about each removal is passed as an argument to
 * `mintBatch` and that data is used to generate the encoded token IDs for each removal.
 * - `decodeRemovalIdV0` is exposed externally for encoding and decoding Removal token IDs that contain uniquely
 * identifying information about the removal. See the [RemovalIdLib docs](../docs/RemovalIdLib.md) for encoding details.
 *
 * ###### Additional behaviors and features
 *
 * - [ERC-1155 functionality](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
 * - [Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
 * - [Initializable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#multiple-inheritance)
 * - [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable): all functions that mutate state are
 * pausable
 * - [Role-based access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
 * - `CONSIGNOR_ROLE`: Can mint removal tokens and list them for sale in the Market contract.
 * - `RELEASER_ROLE`: Can release partial or full removal balances.
 * - `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause and unpause the contract.
 * - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: This is the only role that can add/revoke other accounts to any of the roles.
