/**
 * @title LeagueDAO Fantasy League -- the main contract on the protocol, which is responsible for the main games
 * process.
 *
 * @notice Game process. There are three stages of competitions for users in the Fantasy League game:
 *  1. Weekly competitions lasting 15 weeks. All users take part in them. Each week the user only competes against one
 *     other within their division with the help of their team of staked `Gen2PlayerToken` players. That is, users from
 *     different divisions do not interact.
 *     Users receive special tokens for each week. Winners get more, losers get less. With these tokens, users can buy
 *     new `Gen2PlayerToken` players from the marketplace for replacements in their team. The marketplace is developed
 *     by a different team in a different repository.
 *  2. Then there are the playoff competitions. In 16th week the top 4 users in each division are determined by sorting
 *     them according to their stats for the weekly competitions. In the same week these 4 users compete, each against
 *     one other. In the end there are 2 users left who win. In the 17th week the 2 remaining users in each division
 *     compete and the division winner is determined. Each division winner will receive an equal reward worth several
 *     entry passes (`LeaguePassNFT`) from the reward pool.
 *  3. All division winners participate in the final stage, the Mega League. The number of division winners is equal to
 *     the number of divisions, i.e. one for each division. Immediately after the playoff in the same 17th week, they
 *     will be sorted according to their season stats. The first 10 of them will become the winners of the Mega League.
 *     The reward pool (what is left after the division winners have been rewarded) is distributed between them
 *     according to a set rule.
 *
 * For details and the rest of the functionality, read the abstract contracts comments.
 *
 * Most functions in abstract contracts are placed according to the order in which they are called.
 *
 * The `FantasyLeague` is best read from the bottom, i.e. in the following order: `GameProgress`, `UsersNDivisions`,
 * `RandomGenerator`, `H2HCompetition`, `Scheduler`, `Playoff`, `FantasyLeague`. After reading these contracts or while
 *  reading `H2HCompetition` it is worth getting to know `TeamManager`.
 *
 * @dev The following functionality is implemented directly in this part of the file:
 *  - Initialization of the `FantasyLeague` contract.
 *  - Setting of the `MegaLeague` contract to go to the final stage, the Mega League, at the end of season, as well as
 *    to update its season ID at the setting of it and closing of a season.
 *  - Setting of the `Gen2PlayerToken` contract to update its season ID at the setting of it and closing of a season.
 *  - The function that unifies the game continuation functionality. Calling it back end performs the going to the next
 *    week of the weekly competitions, the going to the playoff and to the Mega League, as well as the closing of the
 *    season and the going to the next one.

 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *

 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
