/**
 *  @notice The ContractsRegistry module
 *
 *  The purpose of this module is to provide an organized registry of the project's smartcontracts
 *  together with the upgradeability and dependency injection mechanisms.
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry should be used as the highest level smartcontract that is aware of any other
 *  contract present in the system. The contracts that demand other system's contracts would then inherit
 *  special `AbstractDependant` contract and override `setDependencies()` function to enable ContractsRegistry
 *  to inject dependencies into them.
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry will help with the following usecases:
 *
 *  1) Making the system upgradeable
 *  2) Making the system contracts-interchangeable
 *  3) Simplifying the contracts management and deployment
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry acts as a Transparent proxy deployer. One can add proxy-compatible implementations to the registry
 *  and deploy proxies to them. Then these proxies can be upgraded easily using the ContractsRegistry.
 *  The ContractsRegistry itself can be deployed behind a proxy as well.
 *
 *  The dependency injection system may come in handy when one wants to substitute a contract `A` with a contract `B`
 *  (for example contract `A` got exploited) without a necessity of redeploying the whole system. One would just add
 *  a new `B` contract to a ContractsRegistry and re-inject all the required dependencies. Dependency injection mechanism
 *  also works with factories.
 *
 *  The management is simplified because all of the contracts are now located in a single place.

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the

 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector

 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
