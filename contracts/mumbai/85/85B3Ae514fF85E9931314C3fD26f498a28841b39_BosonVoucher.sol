/**
 * @title BosonVoucher
 * @notice This is the Boson Protocol ERC-721 Voucher contract.
 *
 * N.B. Although this contract extends OwnableUpgradeable and ERC721Upgradeable,
 *      that is only for convenience, to avoid conflicts with mixed imports.
 *
 *      This is only a logic contract, delegated to by BeaconClientProxy. Thus,
 *      this contract will never be "upgraded". Rather it will be redeployed
 *      with changes and the BosonClientBeacon will be advised of the new address.
 *      Individual seller collections are clones of BeaconClientProxy, which
 *      asks the BosonClientBeacon for the address of the BosonVoucher contract
 *      on each call. This allows us to upgrade all voucher collections cheaply,
 *      and at once.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Only PROTOCOL-roled addresses can issue vouchers, i.e., the ProtocolDiamond or an EOA for testing
 * - Minted to the buyer when the buyer commits to an offer
 * - Burned when the buyer redeems the voucher
 * - Support for pre-minted voucher id ranges

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
